# Summer Report

## Done

### TimeLIME with clustering:
 
* Previous [defect reduction planner](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07416.pdf)
lacks of generality (make plans per instance)

* Now: 
1) cluster instances
2) generate a prototype plan based on each centroid
3) apply the prototype plan to everyone in the neighborhood.

* Result:


### TimeLIME with project health
